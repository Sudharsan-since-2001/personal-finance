Spend Tracker

Personal Finance is a clean and intuitive expense tracking application built to help users understand their spending habits, track daily expenses, and make better financial decisions over time. The focus is on simplicity, clarity, and long-term awareness rather than complex financial jargon.

The project is designed, built, and maintained by Sudharsan, with an emphasis on usability and practical personal finance insights.
